> Roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2018

Below you find a set of chart demonstrating the paths that I'll take to adopt in order to become a frontend.I forked this repository from [developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) created by kamranahmeds.


## Disclaimer
> The purpose of this roadmap is to give me an idea about the landscape and to guide if I am confused about what to learn next and not to encourage me to pick what is hip and trendy.To make clear where I am up to and what is missing in my tech stack I have mentioned green and red star next to each technology which is on demand.
